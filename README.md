FreestyleGunz V8 ESP Source code

This source code contains:
- Health ESP (Toggle ESP with F7 & F8)
- Name ESP (Toggle with F6)
- Anti-HWID ban
- Reset Health/bullets (Home)

and a lot more, like flipmower, lawnmower and more.
Just that, most of it is detected. So they are disabled by default but you can find them easily.
Also, lots of reversed SDK of the game so you can create more stuff ;)
